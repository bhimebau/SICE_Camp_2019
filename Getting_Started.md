## Installing Libraries

The libraries that are required for the camp arduino sessions are
included in the **libraries** folder of the SICE Camp Arduino
Repository that was downloaded above.

Select this option from the Sketch menu: **Sketch->Include Library->Add ZIP Library ...**. One at a time, you should add the 3 libraries in the **libraries** folder. 

**You must restart the arduino IDE software before the libraries will be available.** After you restart the software, you will notice that the following examples are available in **File->Examples->** near the bottom of the list. 

* NewPing 
* TFT Touch Shield v2.0
