# Arduino Session 1 
In this session you will learn about the basics of working with the Arduino embedded system by developing 3 systems. 

## Setup: Get ready to work on the projects
* [Getting Started](Getting_Started.md)

## Challenge 1: Construct a nightlight
* [Example 1 - Hello World](example_1.md)
* [Example 2 - Potentiometer Input](example_2.md)
* [Example 3 - Light Sensor Input](example_3.md)
* [Example 4 - LED Output](example_4.md)
* [Example 5 - Creating a NightLight](example_5.md)

## Challenge 2: Experiment with Sound
* [Tone Melody](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/toneMelody)

## Challenge 3: Create a parking assistant. 
Extend what you have learned to create a device to determine when a car is close enough to the front wall in the garage. 
* [Example 6 - Creating a Parking Buddy](example_6.md)

# Arduino Session 2
In this session you will work with a touch display connected to the Arduino. 

The [TFTP Display Wiki](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/2.8inch_TFT_Touch_Shield_v2.0/) provides a great deal of background information on the display/touch screen. 

Libraries - download as zip files and copy to your Arduino/libraries Folder (see wiki above for additional detail). *Once the library files are copyed, you will need to restart the Arduino IDE for the files to be recognized.*

  * [Touch Screen](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Touch_Screen_Driver)
 
TFT and Touch Screen Examples: Note that there are working example included in **File->Examples**  

### Development Challenges
  * Problem 1: Create a program that moves a circle around the edges of the screen. Try to make the motion of the circle as smooth as possible.  
  * Problem 2: Create a program that generates the IU logo.
  * Problem 3: Create a program that allow you to move a rectangle to a location on the screen specified by the touch of a user. 
  * Problem 4: Extend your solution to Problem 3 by changing the color of the rectangle based on how hard the user is pressing on the screen. See the [TFTP Display Wiki Draw Circle](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/2.8''_TFT_Touch_Shield_V2.0#drawCircle:) explanation for more information on how to generate specific colors.
